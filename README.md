On 02 July 2024, I had my first technical interview, which I failed due to being out of touch with my C# fundamentals. It was embarrassing to see the confusion and disappointment on the interviewer's face as I struggled with the technical assessment.

This experience motivated me to start from scratch and re-learn the C# fundamentals. It also fueled my desire for back-end and full-stack developer roles that will allow me to develop with C#. As I continue to learn, I update this repo with my progress.

This encounter was a valuable learning experience, showing me that understanding the basics is just as important as being able to develop projects. We grow from these experiences and become better developers.
